    "\n",
    "For this purpose, the module [labview_wrapper.py](labview_wrapper.py) was developed, which makes the methods of the [ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper](https://doc.zahner.de/thales_remote/script_wrapper.html#thales_remote.script_wrapper.ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper) object available as functions. These functions can then be executed by LabVIEW.\n",
    "Only one connection to Thales can be established with a Python session.\n",
    "If several connections are required, for example for the heartbeat, several Python sessions are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vi [thales_remote_python.vi](thales_remote_python.vi) which is located in the repository was created as a proof of concept. This contains a simple GUI with which current or voltage can be set and then read.\n",

    "\n",
    "The example shows how to use the [labview_wrapper.py](labview_wrapper.py). First, the connection to Thales must be initialized with `init()` and an IP adderess and afterwards the [ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper](https://doc.zahner.de/thales_remote/script_wrapper.html#thales_remote.script_wrapper.ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper) object is created.\n",
    "The **methods of this object are then transformed into functions** of the module using `transformMethodsToFunctions()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can then be executed by LabVIEW, as LabVIEW can not work directly with the object.\n",
    "All methods of the [ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper](https://doc.zahner.de/thales_remote/script_wrapper.html#thales_remote.script_wrapper.ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper) object are available as functions.\n",
    "This is a simplified example with a small range of functions. In principle, almost all examples in this repository can be visualized with LabVIEW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block executes exactly the same as the LabVIEW flow."
