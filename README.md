![Thales-Remote-Python](https://doc.zahner.de/github_resources/Thales-Remote-Python.png)

Thales-Remote-Python is a Python extension which uses the Zahner [Remote2](https://doc.zahner.de/manuals/remote2.pdf) to control [Zahner ZENNIUM Potentiostats](https://zahner.de/products#potentiostats).  
It was developed to **easily integrate** [Zahner ZENNIUM Potentiostats](https://zahner.de/products#potentiostats) into Python scripts for more **complex measurement** tasks and for **automation purposes**.

The measurement methods **Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**, **Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)**, **Current‚ÄìVoltage characteristic (IE)**,and **DC sequences** are supported. Also constant current or constant voltage can be output and current and voltage can be measured. Single frequency impedance measurement is also possible. Other supported functions are the remote control of the [BC-MUX](https://zahner.de/products-details/multiplexer/bc-mux) and the import of ism files in Python.  

# üìö Documentation

The complete documentation of the individual functions can be found on the [API documentation website](https://doc.zahner.de/thales_remote/).  

# üîß Installation

The package can be installed via pip.

```
pip install thales_remote
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Since v1.1.1 works only with Thales ‚â• 5.8.6. For previous versions of Thales Software, please download an older version of the package.
>
> For example: ``` pip install thales_remote==1.0.1 ```

The class [BCMuxInterface](https://doc.zahner.de/thales_remote/bc_mux_interface.html) to control the [BC-MUX](https://zahner.de/products-details/multiplexer/bc-mux) is located in the Python file [BCMuxInterface.py](Examples/BCMuxInterface/BCMuxInterface.py), from this file the class can be imported.

# üî¨ Measurement Data Analysis

There is a separate Python package on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zahner-elektrik/Zahner-Analysis-Python) and [PyPI/pip](https://pypi.org/project/zahner-analysis/) for analyzing measurement data.

In this repository there are examples of how to fit equivalent electrical circuit models to electrochemical impedance spectra, also known as EIS equivalent circuit fitting. The model parameters can be further processed after the fit with Python, for example for the comparison of serial measurements.

# üî® Basic Usage

The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook [BasicIntroduction.ipynb](Examples/BasicIntroduction/BasicIntroduction.ipynb) explains the fundamentals of using the library.

```python
"""
Connect to the Zahner Zennium Potentiostat
"""
zenniumConnection = ThalesRemoteConnection()
zenniumConnection.connectToTerm("localhost", "ScriptRemote")
zahnerZennium = ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper(zenniumConnection)
zahnerZennium.forceThalesIntoRemoteScript()

"""
Read the measured voltage and current.
"""
print("Potential: " + str(zahnerZennium.getPotential()))
print("Current: " + str(zahnerZennium.getCurrent()))


"""
Single frequency impedance measurement at 1 V DC and 2 kHz
with 10mV amplitude for 3 periods.
"""
zahnerZennium.setPotentiostatMode(PotentiostatMode.POTMODE_POTENTIOSTATIC)
zahnerZennium.setPotential(1)

zahnerZennium.enablePotentiostat()
    
zahnerZennium.setFrequency(2000)
zahnerZennium.setAmplitude(10e-3)
zahnerZennium.setNumberOfPeriods(3)

zahnerZennium.getImpedance()

zahnerZennium.disablePotentiostat()
zenniumConnection.disconnectFromTerm()
```

# üìñ Examples

There is at least one example for each possible electrochemical method that can be controlled remotely.

[BasicIntroduction.ipynb](Examples/BasicIntroduction/BasicIntroduction.ipynb) is the most basic introduction, which describes the connection setup in detail. For each example there is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which explains the example code in detail. For the user there is a Python script for each example which contains the pure Python code so that Jupyter does not need to be installed.

In the examples only one method is explained and parameterized at a time for better comprehension. But the methods can also be combined flexibly in a Python script, for example a CV measurement followed by an EIS measurement.

# ‚úÖ Requirements

Programming is done with the latest Python version at the time of commit.

For the [thales_remote](thales_remote) package only the Python standard library was used.
If measurement data are imported and plotted, the package [zahner_analysis](https://github.com/Zahner-elektrik/Zahner-Analysis-Python) is used.

For standalone communication without Thales with the PP2x2, XPOT2 or EL1002 devices the [zahner_potentiostat](https://github.com/Zahner-elektrik/zahner_potentiostat) package is used.

The packages [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) are used in some examples to display the measurement data graphically.
Jupyter is not necessary, since each example is also available as a Python file.
