The following is an example for troubleshooting when an exception is thrown.

----Example exception----
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\XXX\Thales-Remote-Python\ie_example.py", line 62, in <module>
    zahnerZennium.setIESecondEdgePotential(10000)
  File "C:\XXX\Thales-Remote-Python\ThalesRemote\ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper.py", line 648, in setIESecondEdgePotential
    return self.setValue("IE_EckPot2", potential)
  File "C:\XXX\Thales-Remote-Python\ThalesRemote\ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper.py", line 1026, in setValue
    raise ThalesRemoteError(reply.rstrip("\r") + ThalesRemoteScriptWrapper.undefindedStandardErrorString)
ThalesRemoteError.ThalesRemoteError: ERROR;100;1

----Explanation----

In the last line you can see what kind of error has occurred:

ThalesRemoteError.ThalesRemoteError: ERROR;100;1
    ^                                       ^
    |                                       |
    |        Error number from the Remote2 manual https://doc.zahner.de/manuals/remote2.pdf
    |        You can see in the table in chapter 7 of the manual:
    |        100 | ERROR_PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE | Sent value too low/high
    |
    ThalesRemoteError shows that it is an error generated by the library due to a response from the Zenniums containing an error.

The first two lines of the traceback show the file and line number and the content of the line where the error occurred.  
                          
  File "C:\XXX\Thales-Remote-Python\ie_example.py", line 62, in <module>
    zahnerZennium.setIESecondEdgePotential(10000)
    
            The error occurred in line 62 of the file ie_example.py with the statement zahnerZennium.setIESecondEdgePotential(10000).
            This means that the value 10000, which should be set, is out of the allowed range.
