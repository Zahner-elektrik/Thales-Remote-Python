        To ensure that the switch between Thales and Python/SCPI is interference-free, the following procedure should be followed.
        This is necessary to ensure that both Thales and Python/SCPI have calibrated offsets, otherwise jumps may occur when switching modes:

         1. Connect Zennium with USB and EPC-device/power potentiostat (XPOT2, PP2x2, EL1002) with USB to the computer. As well as Zennium to power potentiostat by EPC cable.
         2. Switch on all devices.
         3. Allow the equipment to warm up for at least 30 minutes.
         4. Select and calibrate the EPC-device in Thales (with Remote2).
         5. Switching the EPC-device to SCPI mode via Remote2 command.
         6. Performing the offset calibration with Python/SCPI.
         7. Then it is possible to switch between Thales and Python/SCPI with the potentiostat switched on.

        With Thales, the DC operating point must first be set.
        When changing the EPC device then measures current and voltage and sets the size internally.
        When switching back to Thales, the same DC operating point must be set as when switching from Thales to USB.
